### Software Developer

### Hi 👋🏻, I’m Renzo Barcos

I have worked as a software developer on various projects over the past 2 years, currently maintaining open source projects and developing blockchain-based applications on Stellar and StarkNet. I am also learning and implementing smart contracts using Cairo and Rust. I love discovering new technologies, although for a long time my main focus has been frontend development.

- 🚀 I currently work as a fullstack developer
- 📚 I am learning Web3 technologies, including smart contracts and decentralized apps
- 🛠️ Maintainer of open source projects like PayStell and StellarRent
- 🔗 Building decentralized applications with Stellar blockchain and Soroban smart contracts
